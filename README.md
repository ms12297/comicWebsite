# The Goodest Boy
## Comic Website Assignment

Our project is a website about a shiba called Bark, and the readers get to spend the day with Bark and see what adventures lie in his day-to-day life when his owner leaves. We wanted to create a fun and playful comic that makes the readers feel good, something that can brighten up their day.

### Process

It all started when we were brainstorming in Baraha, and we were first set on a very deep and complicated comic, however, we felt that that did not fit our vibe. So, we started brainstorming simple ideas for our comics, and thats when we landed on a story about a dog. And, we already had a sketch of a dog, and that further pushed us to work on the idea. In some places, like the ball, we used a combination of Photoshop and Illustrator. We looked online for pictures of elements that we would use in our sketches for our panels. Then, after we prepared our sketches, we composed the finals panels using Photoshop with multiple images on top of each other and converted image files to jpg to make the website run faster.

We first satrted working on our story board to try and figure out the layout of the website and the interactivirty elements. Mccloud's book was very helpful when we were constructing our panels, we used many elements and ideas he suggested in his book like closure and speech bubbles.

Our next step was to sketch the character Bark and get the panels ready so that we can add them into the website. We simultaneously worked on the layout of the website at the same time so that everything was consistent.

For the coding we used AOS library (panel transitions), Howler.js (sound effects), and jQuery (animation) . We tried to set up the panels using the grid, but that complicated the layout of the website so we opted not to use it.
The challenges that we encountered during coding were related to sound and formatting the website, however we managed to get everything set in the end and the website looked great.
In addition, we encountered some inconsistency issues with AOS library where it didn't function properly, this made us realize that there might be bugs in some libraries so they don't always work 100%. For example, some of the elements didnt show up when we wanted them to or took longer to appear. However, on chrome when we click inspect it goes back to normal, so that is something we investigated.

### Reflection

We believe that we achieved our vision for the website, it has a playful feel to it, and the interactivity invites the readers into Bark's life. In addition we found it very fun to meet up and work on the little details of the website like adding in the bloopers and team section in the sidebar. Moreover, we were very dedicated to completing the project on time, so we made sure we had assigned the tasks equally and had done the work to the best of our abilities.



We love Bark and we hope you love him too :) <3
